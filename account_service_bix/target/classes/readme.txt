- DB Project:
Consider that we are a service provider to provide customers different services. 
Each customer can subscribe to multiple service and each service can be subscribed to by multiple customers.
 Come up a database schema to model the service-customer relationship. And use java/html/tomcat/db of your choice to 
 implement a simple web app that will display a customer's subscriptions and let the customer subscribe to a new service, 
 modify or delete a subscribed service.
 
 
 
 This is a springboot project with h2 database embedded in it, so after downloading the project, there is no need to 
 set up the database parameter.
 
The check process is as below :

start DbServiceCustomerApplication.java ===========>open you browser and vist http://localhost:8080/customerList
